<B>Tournament Results</B>
<br>In this project, youâ€™ll be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament. The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

<B>Files</B>
tournament.py - Contains the implementation for the Swiss tournament
tournament.sql - Contains the SQL queries to create the database, tables and views
tournament_test.py - Contains the test cases for tournament.py
